# haus-admin Migration Summary

## Executive Summary

We completed a full ground-up rebuild of the DAOhaus admin app as a standalone Vite + React application, replacing a decade of accumulated monorepo complexity. The app was extracted from an NX/Webpack/Babel monorepo, all `@daohaus/*` npm packages were inlined as local source under `src/lib/`, and every major dependency was modernized: wagmi v1 → v2, react-query v3 → v5, react-router v6 → v7, React 18 → 19, and RainbowKit replaced the bespoke `@daohaus/connect` wallet layer. We then ran a separate structural cleanup pass that reorganized the flat `src/components/`, `src/hooks/`, `src/utils/`, and `src/pages/` folders into a clean `app/` / `features/` / `lib/` architecture. The result is a maintainable, independently deployable app with no monorepo dependency.

## What We Did

### Phase 0–1 — Bootstrap & Core Infrastructure
- Scaffolded a new Vite + React + TypeScript app from scratch
- Wired wagmi v2, viem v2, RainbowKit v2, TanStack Query v5, react-router v7
- Established provider tree (`WagmiProvider` → `QueryClientProvider` → `RainbowKitProvider` → `DaoHooksProvider`)
- Configured path aliases, environment variables, and routing skeleton

### Phase 2 — Data Layer
- Inlined `haus-dao-hooks` as `src/lib/dao-hooks/` (local source, not npm)
- Wired GraphQL data fetching via `graphql-request` v7

### Phase 3 — Shared UI Libraries
- Ported `@daohaus/ui` → `src/lib/ui/` (stripped Storybook, swapped `react-icons` → `lucide-react`)
- Ported `@daohaus/utils` → `src/lib/utils/`
- Ported `@daohaus/keychain-utils` → `src/lib/keychain-utils/`
- Ported `@daohaus/abis` → `src/lib/abis/`

### Phase 4 — Read Pages (Data Display)
- Implemented all data-display pages: Home, DaoOverview, Proposals, Proposal detail, Members, Member detail, Safes, Settings
- Integrated DAO data hooks throughout

### Phase 5 — Write Pages (Transactions & Forms)
- Ported `@daohaus/tx-builder` → `src/lib/tx-builder/`
- Ported `@daohaus/form-builder` + `form-builder-base` → `src/lib/form-builder/`
- Ported `@daohaus/moloch-v3-legos` + `moloch-v3-fields` → `src/lib/legos/`
- Implemented all transaction flows: sponsor, vote, process, cancel, rage quit, update settings
- Migrated the Summon app

### Phase 6 — Polish & Modernization
- Enabled TypeScript strict mode and resolved all resulting errors
- Tuned React Query stale/gc times by query type
- Added environment variable validation at startup
- Removed dead Farcaster code
- Added `ErrorBoundary` components at page level
- Upgraded to Etherscan v2 (single API key replaces 6 chain-specific keys)

### Repo Structure Simplification (Phases 0–7)
- Removed duplicate artifacts: redundant component files, duplicate logger implementation, duplicate SVG asset
- Unified lego entry points — eliminated competing `src/legos/` vs `src/lib/legos/`
- Collapsed two utils namespaces into one (`src/lib/utils/`) with feature-specific utils colocated in their feature folders
- Separated app hooks from data hooks by location (`src/app/hooks/`, `src/features/*/hooks/` vs `src/lib/dao-hooks/`)
- Reorganized flat `src/components/` into feature domains under `src/features/*/components/`
- Renamed `src/layout/` → `src/app/layouts/`, `src/pages/` → `src/app/routes/`
- Trimmed alias surface to three stable roots: `@/lib/*`, `@/app/*`, `@/features/*`

## What This Means for Future RG Clients

- **LLM-optimized structure matters.** The `app/` / `features/` / `lib/` split with minimal alias surface was explicitly designed to be navigable by AI agents, not just humans. This is a selling point for the AI maintenance offering.
- **Dependency modernization is bundleable.** Clients often resist large dependency upgrades because they seem risky. Running them as a single structured sprint (wagmi, react-query, react-router, React all in one pass) proved faster and less disruptive than incremental upgrades.
